"""Raw BVH hygiene, shared across dataset preprocessing scripts.

3ds Max Biped rigs export every joint with 6 channels (position + rotation),
not just the root, and wrap the true root in a redundant zero-offset child
joint. Neither quirk is Truebones-specific -- any future dataset sourced
from the same export lineage (Mixamo, other Biped-rigged BVH dumps) hits it
too, which is why this lives here rather than under a Truebones-named
module. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-truebones-preprocessing-design.md.
